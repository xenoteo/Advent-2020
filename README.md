# Advent 2020
Advent od Code 2020.

## Problems
- \[[day 1](https://github.com/xenoteo/Advent-2020/tree/master/src/xenoteo/com/github/day1)\]
  - \[[part 1](https://github.com/xenoteo/Advent-2020/blob/master/src/xenoteo/com/github/day1/part1/Solution.java)\] - finding the two entries that sum to x and then multiply those two numbers together.
  - \[[part 2](https://github.com/xenoteo/Advent-2020/blob/master/src/xenoteo/com/github/day1/part2/Solution.java)\] - finding the three entries that sum to x and then multiply those three numbers together.
- \[[day 2](https://github.com/xenoteo/Advent-2020/tree/master/src/xenoteo/com/github/day2)\] - each line gives the password policy and then the password. Counting how many passwords are valid according to the policies.
  - \[[part 1](https://github.com/xenoteo/Advent-2020/blob/master/src/xenoteo/com/github/day2/part1/Solution.java)\] - the password policy indicates the lowest and highest number of times a given letter must appear for the password to be valid.
  - \[[part 2](https://github.com/xenoteo/Advent-2020/blob/master/src/xenoteo/com/github/day2/part2/Solution.java)\] - each policy describes two positions in the password, where 1 means the first character. Exactly one of these positions must contain the given letter.
- \[[day 3](https://github.com/xenoteo/Advent-2020/tree/master/src/xenoteo/com/github/day3)\] - having a map of the open squares (.) and trees (#). These aren't the only trees, though; the same pattern repeats to the right many times.
  - \[[part 1](https://github.com/xenoteo/Advent-2020/blob/master/src/xenoteo/com/github/day3/part1/Solution.java)\] - counting how many trees can be encountered starting at the top-left corner of the map and following a slope of right 3 and down 1.
  - \[[part 2](https://github.com/xenoteo/Advent-2020/blob/master/src/xenoteo/com/github/day3/part2/Solution.java)\] - counting how many trees can be encountered starting at the top-left corner of the map and following given slopes, and then multiplying founded results together.
